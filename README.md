# Angular SSR with NestJS

In this branch we have setup a few endpoints on the server and interact with it

# Interesting code
1. fetch-data.service.ts  
* here we have 2 sets of implementations of getData method. The first one is to demo 'TransferHttpCacheModule'. (Uncomment the imports in app module)  
* the one shows how to use 'TransferState'
